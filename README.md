## TechniciansLogs

This Project is a **React App** which is built for an imaginary IT department to maintain **System Logs**(day to day system activities) by various technicians who work in this firm.

### Framework & API Reference

- Built this with **React** and used **Redux** for managing App-level-state.
- I used **json-server** as a mock backend for building this web-app's backend.
- It acts as a Fake REST API for the app.
- I will build the entire backend of the app with NodeJS and Express later on but for now json-server is used for prototyping and will serve the purpose. Also, I will try to make the UI better.

### Run Locally

Since, json-server acts as the backend for the app, that's why it is not deployed.  
But you can follow these simple steps to run locally on your machine.

#### Step - 1

Make sure you have NodeJS installed on your machine so that you can install the dependencies and run the app.  
 Download it from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/)  
 Clone or Download this repo and open project folder `technicians-logs` in your code-editor.

#### Step - 2

Now, Open your terminal and run below given command ðŸ‘‡

```
npm install
```

This will install all the neccessary dependencies of the project.

#### Step - 3

Now, run the command ðŸ‘‡

```
npm run dev
```

wait for few minutes and the React App will open up in your browser at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)  
That's it ðŸ˜€
